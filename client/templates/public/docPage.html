  	<h2>lo-fi augmented reality for the mobile web</h2>
  	<p> annotatAR provides a look at the ghostly voices of Twitter during events that co-occur in the related sites of the "outernet" or "real world" as well as the networked universe of a virtual settlement on a Twittter hashtag.</p>

  	<p>When annotatAR is deployed at a mutli-sited event, the hashtag is paired with geocoordinates. When someone visits the site in the outernet and loads <a href="/ar.html">url</a> on their mobile device, they will see the voices from the Twitter settlement overlaid on their subjective reality.</p>

  	<p>The project blog for annotatAR can be found <a href="http://arebe.github.io/annotatar">here</a>. Currently the site is available for devices and browsers that support WebRTC and HTML5 canvas technology</p>
